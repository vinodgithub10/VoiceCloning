# Speech Translation using Python

This Python script uses the `speech_recognition` library to recognize speech in a WAV audio file, then translates the recognized text from English to Hindi using the `googletrans` library. Finally, it converts the translated text into an MP3 audio file using `gTTS`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Place your WAV audio file in the specified path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Voice_cloning/Sundar Pichai Commencement Speech.wav`.

2. Run the script: `python translate_speech.py`.

3. The translated speech will be saved as "translated_speech.mp3".

## Configuration

You can configure the language and speed of the translation by modifying the script.
